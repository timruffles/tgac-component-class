# Component Design Class

## Install

```sh
cd path/to/this/repo
npm install
```

## Structure

```sh
# here are the slides, in HTML format, yours to take home and enjoy! simply open slides/index.html in your favourite brower
./slides 

# whenever we're working on an exercise together, I'll point you to an exercise subfolder
./exercises
```

## Exercises

Each exercise is a subfolder. Exercises have an `exercise.js` file.

So, for instance, to run the first exercise:

```sh
cd path/where/you/downloaded/this/repo
cd exercises/custom-elements

open index.html
# edit exercise.js
```
