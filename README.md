##Â Weclome


It's a priviledge to welcome you to the Advanced JS Class! Today we're going to look at getting the best from the JS of today and the near future: ES6 and beyond.

The class is exercise driven, so it's worth having a glance over the below to learn how to run the exercises.

## Structure

```sh
# here are the slides, in HTML format, yours to take home and enjoy! simply open slides/index.html in your favourite brower
./slides 

# whenever we're working on an exercise together, I'll point you to an exercise subfolder
./exercises
```

## Exercises

Each exercise is a subfolder. You check your work by navigating to the folder in your terminal and running `npm run verify`.

Some exercises have an `exercise.js` file. Some have a `start-here.js` file where we right tests - this is for learning about TDD (test-driven development).

So, for instance, to run the first exercise:

```sh
cd path/where/you/downloaded/this/repo
cd exercises/modules

node verify.js
```
